# Assets Directory

This directory contains visual assets for the PromptProof documentation.

## Required Assets

### red-green.gif
A 5-7 second GIF showing a red→green PR demonstration. This should show:

- The PR turning green after fixes

**Recommended dimensions:** 1280×640 or similar aspect ratio
**File size:** Keep under 5MB for optimal loading

## Adding Assets

1. Place your GIF/image files in this directory
2. Update the README.md to reference the correct filename
3. Ensure assets are optimized for web (compressed, reasonable file sizes)

## Current Status
